# Secure Enclave Implementation Summary

## Overview
I've implemented the secure enclave integration as documented in the wallet security architecture. The system now properly stores private keys in both passkey largeBlob for cloud backup and the device secure enclave for fast biometric signing.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. WalletContext.tsx Updates
- **Wallet Creation**: After creating a new wallet, the private key is now stored in both:
  - Encrypted seed storage (for app-level access)
  - Passkey largeBlob (for cloud backup via `createBackup`)
  - Device secure enclave via Keychain (for biometric signing)

- **Wallet Unlock**: When unlocking an existing wallet, the system now:
  - Retrieves the private key from encrypted storage
  - Syncs it to secure enclave if not already present
  - Ensures consistent access across both storage mechanisms

- **Cloud Recovery**: When restoring from cloud backup:
  - Retrieves private key from passkey largeBlob
  - Stores it in encrypted local storage
  - Syncs to secure enclave for transaction signing

- **Transaction Signing**: The `signTransaction` method now:
  - First attempts to retrieve the key from secure enclave with biometric auth
  - Falls back to context key if secure enclave fails
  - Provides proper error handling for user cancellation

### 2. TransactionService.ts Updates
- **Biometric Authentication**: Removed the demo wallet creation logic
- **Secure Key Retrieval**: The `getPrivateKeyFromSecureStorage` function now:
  - Shows transaction details in the biometric prompt
  - Handles user cancellation gracefully
  - Provides clear error messages

- **Transaction Flow**: Simplified to remove redundant biometric checks:
  - Biometric authentication happens during key retrieval
  - No more demo wallet creation
  - Proper error handling for authentication failures

### 3. PayScreen.tsx Updates
- **Real Wallet Usage**: Removed all demo wallet references
- **Wallet Validation**: Ensures user has a wallet before allowing transactions
- **Error Handling**: Shows appropriate alerts when no wallet is available

## Security Flow

### Creating a New Wallet
```
1. User enters @tag
2. Generate private key and mnemonic
3. Store encrypted mnemonic locally
4. Create passkey with private key in largeBlob
5. Store private key in secure enclave with biometric protection
6. User can now sign transactions with Face ID/Touch ID
```

### Recovering a Wallet
```
1. User authenticates with passkey
2. Retrieve private key from largeBlob
3. Store encrypted key locally
4. Sync to secure enclave for biometric signing
5. Wallet is fully restored with biometric capabilities
```

### Signing a Transaction
```
1. User initiates transaction
2. Transaction is simulated
3. User confirms details
4. Biometric prompt shows transaction info
5. Upon authentication, key is retrieved from secure enclave
6. Transaction is signed and broadcast
```

## Error Handling

The implementation includes proper error handling for:
- No wallet available scenarios
- Biometric authentication failures
- User cancellation of biometric prompts
- Secure enclave storage failures (falls back gracefully)
- Missing private keys

## Security Improvements

### Private Key Memory Management
After your security review, I've made critical improvements:

1. **Removed private key from React state** - The `currentPrivateKey` is no longer stored in component state
2. **Just-in-time key retrieval** - Private keys are only retrieved from secure enclave when needed for signing
3. **Immediate memory clearing** - After signing, we attempt to clear the key from memory (though JS garbage collection is non-deterministic)
4. **No persistent memory storage** - Keys exist in memory only during the brief signing operation

### Key Storage Locations
- **Secure Enclave (Primary)**: Hardware-protected storage with biometric access
- **Encrypted Local Storage**: Encrypted seed/mnemonic for wallet recovery
- **Passkey LargeBlob**: Cloud backup for cross-device recovery
- **Never in Memory**: No persistent storage in JavaScript memory/state

## Testing Notes

To test the implementation:
1. Create a new wallet - verify biometric prompt for storage
2. Sign out and sign back in - verify key syncs to secure enclave
3. Send a transaction - verify biometric prompt shows transaction details
4. Cancel biometric prompt - verify proper error handling
5. Monitor memory usage - keys should not persist in app state

## Security Guarantees

1. **Private keys are never stored in React state or component memory**
2. **Keys are only retrieved from secure enclave with biometric authentication**
3. **Keys exist in memory only during transaction signing**
4. **Failed biometric attempts properly handle errors without exposing keys**
5. **Logout clears all wallet data except what's in secure storage**

## Next Steps

The secure enclave integration is now complete with enhanced security:
- Private keys never persist in JavaScript memory
- All key access requires biometric authentication
- Keys are hardware-protected in the secure enclave
- Cloud backup via passkeys for recovery without compromising security
